# EDGE_ML_WITH_PYTHON

## Description
This project contains machine learning models and code that performs classification tasks on various datasets. The aim of the project is to explore different machine learning algorithms, process the data effectively, and evaluate the models for accuracy.

The project includes:
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for training models.
- **Model training**: Training multiple machine learning models (e.g., **Support Vector Machine**, **Neural Networks**, **Decision Trees**).
- **Model evaluation**: Evaluating the models using **accuracy, precision**, and **recall** metrics.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the results to compare model performances.

## Files
- **Python Scripts**:
  - `preprocessing.py`: Contains code for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
  - `train_model.py`: Script to train machine learning models (SVM, MLP, Decision Tree).
  - `evaluate_model.py`: Contains code to evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
  - `visualize_results.py`: Contains scripts for plotting graphs and comparing models.
  
- **Data Files**:
  - `B43_4_Final.csv`: The main dataset used in the project for classification tasks.
  - `CC_GENERAL.csv`: An additional dataset used for evaluation.
  
- **Others**:
  - `requirements.txt`: A file listing the dependencies required to run the project.
  - `README.md`: This file, explaining the project in detail.
  
## Requirements
